# hosts

This is a Work In Progress host list i'm making for my UK LG OLED C2 TV.  I'm trying to stop the pop-up notifications when turning the TV on each day.

I did originally have 29 Host blocked, unfortunately this stopped thumbnails in the YouTube App & also stopped the App store working correctly
and also stopped any Apps opening when needed an Update.

I've reduced the block list to the level that the App Store and Apps i use work correctly. (App Store, YouTube, Disney+, Prime Video, Netflix) 

I've listed the 2x Update domains to add to your Pi-Hole domains list to blacklist, but whitelist when you want to run any updates.

I'll update this host lists periodically when i notice any other
